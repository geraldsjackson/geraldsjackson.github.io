I've been watching the British Television Show [<font color="blue">Humans</font>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_(TV_series)) for a few episodes now (<strong>Note: I've finished series 1 since beginning this post</strong>), and what was, and is, immediately striking about the show is how gendered practices play out across human/machine relationships. In a few cases, there are interactions that, to me, portray an interesting breakdown between the artificial and the real as material-discursive phenomena. Before I continue, I think as a side note I would say that there are many other places in which the show reifies these binaries, especially the notion of a buried consciousness inside the minds of "awakened," sentient cyborgs, is represented by some piece or pieces of code. I think that there are more complex debates regarding the actual reality of AI to be had, but I'm not doing that here. It is in other places that I believe we get an interesting view of how gender and artificiality are used, and abused, for particular reasons.

<strong>For those not familiar to the show, there are some light spoilers here.</strong>

The show, for those still with me, revolves around an near- or alternate-future where artificial beings, called "synthetics" or "synths," exist as household appliances for humanity. Fashioned to mimic humanity,  these machines do not have "true" or strong AI, as a John Searle might demand, but instead function as high-level expert systems that work as servants or drones. They, physically, are indistinguishable from humans until they speak or move. While the main narrative of the show follows a group of these synths (and a human cyborg, but that is a topic for another talk) who have achieved true consciousness--they feel and express emotions, understand human subtlety and complexity (often, the non-sentience synths express robotic confusion when their human counterparts tell jokes or express sarcasm), there are a few sub-plots. One, interesting for me, is the gendered dynamics between humans and synths. Since the synths are outwardly human-like, there are a few instances (and it is implied that this is normal) where characters form emotional/sexual attachments to their synths. 

Not everyone has a synth(they are a luxury for many, like a sports car), so a split forms to broadly define two character types: those who are content to relegate synths as a normal part of the background of everyday life (that is, normalizing them as appliances), and those who constantly feel unease, unsettled by the uncanny and disconcerting relationship to human-resembling non-humans, which immediately situates many of the characters in the overlap between treating the synths as citizens, family, or friends, or appliances.

Synths, as appliances, perform a significant amount of emotional work, work that is not predicated on any notion that a given synth is self-aware or not. Odi, an older model of synth owned by Dr. George Millican (who helped design the first synths before the events of the show), serves as a link between Dr. Millican and his deceased wife. Odi, as a computer, has memory of the painful past and often, unbidden, speaks of those events to George. George, accordingly, resists the pressure to "recycle" Odi by his health insurance provider who wishes to upgrade Odi to a newer caretaker model. Odi, unlike a picture or voice recording, is like a child that never ages. More painful for George, Odi is like a child that will say the wrong things at the wrong time, evoking the past unexpectedly--often by simply walking in the room. And yet in the articulation of his memory Odi continually links George to his past. While the insurance company sees Odi as a replaceable object, George situates Odi as an emotional appliance, a walking performance of memory that he only partially controls. This lack of total control, the lack of total control over the medium of memory, makes those memories all the more powerful.

The notion of an emotional appliance becomes all the more relevant in this show when factoring in gender. Anita, a synth who had formerly possessed sentience but lost it after reprogramming, is purchased by Joe Hawkins, despite the protests of his wife, Laura. Anita was built as young, attractive, and gentle, a model to function in service roles such as housekeeping or care giving. Upon purchasing Anita, Joe is given her instruction manual, which includes a code to unlock "adult" mode--a mode that allows the machine to express and perform sexuality with her primary user. This becomes relevant to the relationship between Joe and Laura, as it is implied early on that Laura is distant, often leaving for work, working long hours, or finding excuses to remain out of the house. While her distance is tied to a tragedy in her past, Joe reads her distance as evidence of infidelity, and one night he activates Anita's adult mode to satiate his own anger and frustration.

Once his indiscretions are brought to the attention of his family, he is shunned not only by his wife but by his children, who have come to see Anita as a member of the household. Joe, as he defends himself for his actions, repeatedly asserts that she is just a doll--she cannot feel anything, therefore nothing truly harmful was done. This denial of her as a sexual object at the moment that he is shamed by his family for objectifying her as a sexual object situates her femininity at a crossroads between her sexual appropriation, her familial appropriation, and her ability to perform the norms of gendered labor within the house. At the same time, it highlights the implications of a gendered technology: plugged in to a set of sexual, cultural, and social practices, Anita <em>is</em> already sexual because while she is compliant, she is, like Odi, not entirely under the control of the user. Her body is an appliance for Joe in multiple ways, but it also resists the total objectification that would equate her with, say, a toaster or a refrigerator. Thus her controlled agency, her programmed freedom, constructs a gender of unresisting existence--she is not a doll, and yet she is a doll. 

Jack Halberstam, in "Automating Gender," argues that gendered technology, rather than robbing women of some essential, naturalized essence, highlights the technicity of the gendered body. He writes that "the intelligent and female cyborg thinks gender, processes power, and converts a binary system of logic into a more intricate network" (454). That is, the melding of gender and technology into constituent parts (merging the natural and the technological), the female cyborg unsettles the distinction of technology from gender and evokes "something unsettling, something that profoundly disturbs and frightens certain authors" (454). On the one hand, this opens space for the technicity of gender, a breaking from the "natural" binary of man and women, the head and the body, technology and nature. On the other, since the female cyborg disrupts the gendered separation of nature (or the body, in this case) and technology, it disrupts social relationships of gendered power by implicating technology (as knowledge) within the collapse of that split. It refuses to mobilize gender in a natural context, and simultaneously opens the horizon of gender expression and exposes the mechanisms by which gender as technology oppresses. Joe's usage of Anita as an emotional appliance is an example of how gendered technology exposes the violence of binary logics of sexuality. She is, in every sense of the word, helpless before Joe. I should note here that Joe is not portrayed as a violent or corrupted man. Rather, he is a confused and frustrated husband and father who, when given the opportunity, expresses that frustration on an artificially-willing female body through unquestionable sexual submission. Her automated gender is as such that she can immediately blur the lines of nature and technology in ways that reify destructive gender logics (she can have sex with Joe, but can never resist him once activated). This allows Joe a dominant sexual outlet, rather than a productive one that would question his own gendered approaches to his relationship with his wife (conversation, emotional openness, therapy, etc.). 

In Anita, the technological body (the bodies that are already technical) find new conduits to express gender disparity, and to circulate that disparity through the characters of the show (show can have sex with her without her resistance, but not without the resistance of the family). Emotional appliances therefore are the uncomfortable expressions of emotion that play across technology that has been seen up to now as ungendered, or at least outside of nature or the natural. Halberstam writes that "the body may be scientifically altered in order to force 'correct' gender identification, but desire remains as interference running across a binary technologic" (444). That is, as an emotional appliance, Anita (among others) embodies how desire is a performative aspect of technology, particularly in how technology situates bodies as usable, disposable, and sexual.

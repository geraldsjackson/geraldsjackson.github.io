I  [<font color="blue">came across this site during some of my research</font>](https://latexforhumans.wordpress.com/) regarding the question of how to manage a large document such as a book or dissertation outside of the Microsoft Word software. I don't think that this is a "new" thing for some, but I don't know  anyone using anything other than a word processor to write their dissertations (or, perhaps, Scrivener) outside of engineering or some of the sciences, which has made it hard to ask around about it. At the same time, everyone with an opinion online has warned against using Word or Word-like software (LibreOffice, Pages) to manage a large document like a dissertation.

This could be a big mistake, as I have to learn a few things more about the language, but as I move forward I think that I might have stumbled upon something great. The ease of creating smaller sections in separate documents that I can place within a logical structure and compile makes this method much more flexible and intuitive for me, and allows me to 

<ol>
    <li>easily compile a large document after adding sections,</li>
    <li>control the formatting of the entire document through a central, master compilation file,</li>
    <li>create smaller compilation files for smaller sections (chapters in particular, which will be nice when I need to provide writing samples, and</li>
    <li>manage my bibliography through software like <a href="https://mendeley.com/"><font color="blue">Mendeley</font></a>, which can output a bibliography as a Latex-ready database.</li>
    </ol>

I will probably make updates here with references that may help others as I continue.

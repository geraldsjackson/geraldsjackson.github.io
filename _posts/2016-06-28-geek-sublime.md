The New York Times recently posted a story on the operationalization of gender and race in computer code, an observation that most people will find either painfully obvious or incredibly enlightening. The former group, however, I have found do not appreciate the value of articulating such an insight to a general audience. This is disheartening, as it suggests a separation between academic specialists and the audience that they would supposedly engage (outside themselves). That is why I appreciate Vikram Chandra's <em>Geek Sublime</em>. Chandra, writing about the cultural aspects of computation and computer culture traces his own history with computers with incredible care and wit, inviting and educating audiences unfamiliar with either. It is clear from the very beginning that Chandra loves working on computers. A student of literature and language, Chandra began his education studying writing and literature, first pursuing the "classics" (the western, European canon) and eventually moving through the literature and history of his own Indian culture. Alongside this, his increasing interest in working on technology and helping others with their technical problems (those with some technological know-how will be familiar with this). 

Chandra's personal journey mirrors a cultural journey, the journey of his country post-WWII as communication and computation became heavy markets for global capital and military advancement. India, as Chandra points out, was at the forefront in importing technological know-how into local universities (ironically, by exporting students to universities in the United States and Europe). India invested money into the digital boom before there was such a boom, and as such Chandra ties together the relationship of freedom, modernization, and the global economy. Chandra's orientation between the western and Indian culture, between literature and technology, articulates a world in which these areas are not completely separate. This is a world where algorithmic thinking is at the heart of Indian language, where the beauty of language works through code, and where critical approaches to both, each informed by the other, is necessary. Chandra's early chapters delve into the pressing questions of race, class, and gender as technological issues, describing a culture dominated by white, western interests and practices. 

On the more technical side, his discussion of the programming language [<font color="blue">Brainfuck</font>](http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) begins an interesting discussion of programming as expressive, but also as interminable and exhausting. The politics of programming labor include the question of what it means to <em>be</em> a laborer, to keep up in a race of conferences, new languages, and constant demands to produce and engage. This, in some ways, reminds me of other labor models in which workers are seen as white-collar, privileged, and therefore above exploitation. 

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

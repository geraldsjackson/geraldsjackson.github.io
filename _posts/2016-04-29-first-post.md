David Budde [<font color="blue">discusses how the concept of swarm intelligence is reframing Eurpoean politics</font>](https://www.opendemocracy.net/david-budde/all-politics-swarm-intelligence-and-subterranean-politics-in-germany), using the Pirate Party as an exmaple of such political work.

Apparently, the Pirate Party uses a platform called "Liquid Feedback" (aka, [<font color="blue">The Democracy Software</font>](http://liquidfeedback.org/)) to perform a new politics. Budde writes that "The Pirate Party does not stand for certain policies, but for a new way of doing politics that challenges established notions of parliamentary democracy." 

Can we equate a swarm intelligence, framed as a political performance, with democracy? It seems to be radically distributed, in that the party does not vote on any particular issue, but on the issues voted on by users of their Liquid Feedback platorm. But, otherwise, while this is seemingly a move towards radical participation, it also demonstrates a concern in how we produce a democratic practice in software. Is that possible? What does it mean to "code" a democracy?

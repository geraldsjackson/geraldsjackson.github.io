<p>As an interdisciplinary scholar, my research sits at the intersection between three overlapping areas of study: rhetoric, queer and gender studies, and media studies. My work draws from these areas in order to describe the gendered performativity of code through software and digital communication networks, and offers a method of critical inquiry into the gendered nature of digital technology and the gendered relationships between digital code and software engineering communities.</p>

<p>In my dissertation, I argue that source code and network protocols circulate gender and sexuality through relationships of digital labor. While critical code and media studies have introduced scholarship on the study of software and computer code, I extend such work and develop a digital methodology rooted in queer and gender studies to demonstrate how technology is already inherently gendered. Representational studies of code situate it as text or procedure, but I argue that to understand how code performs gender, it becomes necessary to study how networks of code libraries and functionality produce social and subjective formations of gender. My approach to code and networks looks at three logics of software and networks–mastery, swarms, and trust–as performative mechanisms that articulate gendered subjectivities and ideologies. Thus, my research identifies the function of source code as an articulation of gendered knowledge-making practices and sites of possible resistance that critical media and gender scholars can work in to critique and subvert such practices.</p>

<p>Beyond the dissertation, I foresee my research expanding the critical space for a gendered study of software and digital subjectivity and agency. My upcoming chapter in the edited collection <em>Rhetoric, Writing, and Circulation</em> outlines an approach to the study of digital networks through a rhetoric of protocol. I argue that by looking at the source protocols and logic of the Bitcoin network, scholars can make claims about the discursive positions that emerge from such a network. Furthermore, my article in <em>JOGLTEP: Journal of Global Literacies, Technologies, and Emerging Pedagogies</em> theorizes multimodal, rhetorical agency through theories of queer sexuality and rhetorical code studies. Through these two works, I illustrate the relationships between code and subjectivity as a study of performativity. I more fully demonstrate code’s relation to gender in sexuality in an article under review with <em>QED: A Journal of GLBTQ Worldmaking</em> invited for revision and resubmission. In this essay, I discuss the notion of computational performativity, or how code performs a masculinized knowledge-making practice of mastery through gendered assumptions of labor. Women have recently been recuperated as integral to the development of computer programming as a field, and following this I demonstrate how knowledge-making practices evident in source code perform some of the gendered relations apparent in software development.
<br /></p>

<p>While my doctoral work is ostensibly focused on theories of rhetoric, media, and gender, I am also trained in writing pedagogy. My teaching incorporates my interest in media and critical theory, and I have taught successful classes in first year composition, basic writing, and professional and technical writing. Throughout all of these courses, I maintain a high level of rhetorical and analytical rigor while including multimodal and digital activities. My pedagogy seeks to cultivate a critical awareness of discourse and language through different media, and to encourage students to see the applicability of what they learn in the classroom through multiple communicative situations. I also served as Assistant Director of First Year English at USC for two years, where I helped edit the English 102 textbook, plan curriculum, and observe graduate instructors. My major task as Assistant Director involved managing a joint project between the English department and the Center for Digital Humanities. This project seeks to build a corpus of student papers from first-year classrooms for storage and analysis purposes.</p>

<p>Offering a performative media context for rhetoric, situated at the intersection of queer studies and media theory, Speaker 1 raises the question of “modality” as an extension and expansion of how scholars might approach the theorization of rhetorical agency. Beginning with the conversation of agency between Cheryl Geisler (2009) and Christian Lundberg and Joshua Gunn (2009) in the pages of Rhetoric Society Quarterly, Speaker 1 connects the central questions of that debate to further work in digital rhetoric tied to agency (Grabill and Pigg, Brooke, Rice). Then, studying queer activist Zach Blas’s digital piece “transCoder,” a speculative software development kit, Speaker 1 foregrounds the question of agency through a discussion of modality, specifically through the contours of Blas’s performative/computational work. Through a reading of queer theories of performance and embodied technics in Butler (1999), Julian Gil-Peterson (2014), and José Esteban Muñoz (1999) alongside Jussi Parikka’s (2011) materialist theory of media, a rhetorical performative media emerges from a framework of agential modality in which agency is a manifestation of the logics of mediation. transCoder, following Blas and queer theorist Muñoz’s, exemplifies a “digital disidentification,” a performative practice that recognizes the (sometimes paradoxical) registers of actions and effects that circulate through digital media. Speaker 1 suggests digital disidentification offers a way to understand and rework these channels of circulation at the level of the media itself.

<p><a href=""><img src="" /></a>The First Year English program at the University of South Carolina at Columbia, in conjunction with the USC Center for Digital Humanities, is developing an application to gather, organize, and analyze a corpus of first-year student writing, structured around questions of revision and writing complexity. FYE Director Dr. Chris Holcomb and computer scientist Dr. Duncan Buell, along with CDH programmers, are currently developing algorithms to perform textual analysis on pairs of student papers to track changes between original drafts and final submissions, including any modifications in clause and phrase usage, sentence complexity, and overall structural reworking. I will present a report regarding the mission and goals of the project, as well as our plan for its implementation at USC and amongst partner schools, our timeline, how we intend to use this corpus as a heuristic for programmatic goals (including curriculum and teacher training), and how this will benefit teachers of English and Composition more broadly.

<p>Prior to the release of the iPhone 5c, a then-new, cheaper iPhone built with coloed plastic, a report issued by the investigative group China Labor Watch leaked information about the phone to the general public (which had, up until that point, been left with only rumors and speculation). The explosion of reporting on the phone was immediately entangled with questions of labor and human rights abuses, to the point where it quickly became apparent that our fascination with new communication technologies is inextricably linked to the ethical imperative of understanding our position in an economy of labor exploitation. This presentation asks how this is relevant to the writing class. As the field has, and continues to, shift towards writing in New Media platforms, how do we respond to the implication of our writing and teaching practices within a world of exploitative labor? How do we simultaneously posit new media as the future of rhetoric, civil engagment, and deliberation, when the very makeup of that future is one built on a network of global capital and stratification? When the technologies we situate as the grounds of a new political participation are rooted in incredibly non-democratic practices? And, finally, how do we recognize this as a pedagogial imperative?

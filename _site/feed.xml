    &lt;p&gt;Since I presented on the third day of the conference, I approached it in a state of exhaustion and excitement. Presenting is always exciting, but after a full day the previous day (including the Coalition of Women Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition and &lt;em&gt;Enculturation&lt;/em&gt; parties) left me a bit slow to go that morning. Since our panel – 015, “Sex, Consent, and Digital Disidentifications in Queer Media and Technology” – didn’t begin until 11:00am I had time to sleep a little and prepare. I realized that I missed some interesting panels but I am never one to forego nervous, last-minute quadruple-checking of all that I needed to do, followed by multiple radings of the presentation. Luckily, my co-panelists were Jacqueline Rhodes, Jonathan Alexander, and Michael J. Faris, who were all wonderful. Much of my excitement stemmed from the fact that this was the first panel I had put together, and that my co-panelists had agreed to be a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacquie and Jonathan both presented on Object Oriented Ontology and the question of consent. After beginning with a discussion of OOO through Ian Bogost’s work in &lt;em&gt;Alien Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt;, Rhodes and Alexander suggested that such an approach qould not be able to give us a position to ask the question “Do Objects concent” to our use of them, and instead invoked Jane Bennet’s &lt;em&gt;Vibrant Matter&lt;/em&gt;. The claim of these speakers (who presented in tandem, alternating speaking roles in their presentation) was not an argument that objects could consent to our use, but that we can’t argue that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; can’t consent either. To impose the question of consent on matter implies an inability to think about the inner workings of matter, but at the same time a limitation to our knowledges about the participatory nature of matter in our lives, including in how we make decisisions about concent. Their argument suggested that in considering matter as part of embodied, decision-making processes, we could in fact open up what it means to give or recieve consent for any action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael’s presentation focused on the embodied materiality of the online dating service Grindr, targeted primarily to a gay male users looking for companionship, sex, coffee, or simply conversation. True to the title of the panel, this was a “sensory ethnography,” in that Michael took us through the world of Grindr through his own experiences, displaying his user account profile and discussing when, why, and how the app participated in his life. His take on Grindr was that his connection to the app, and the communing, is such that there are powerful affective, embodied responses that the app provokes. This can come from more straightforward cues (the use of profile pictures and body shots) and on cues tied to the app itself (updates, notifications, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I prepare to go onto the market in the fall and finish my dissertation, this year’s RSA was a welcome reminder of how excited I can feel about the field and my potential place in it. It makes me much more hopeful and energized for the upcoming fall.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The second day of RSA was a full one. I don’t often panel from morning to night, but with the fall Job Market coming up I wanted to be present at as many panels as possible and meet a few people. I could, throughout the 2-3 days that I was present in Atlanta, palpably feel the upcoming job search: some of these folks, hopefully, would run searches for their respective universities, perhaps sit on hiring committees, perhaps even become future colleagues. As I prepare my dissertation and my documents, I feel a mix of excitement and uncertainty, but also hope–the conversations I had tended to ground me in my work and the people who share my interests in the field, and helped calm some of the uncertainties that I felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Panels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most fun panels I went to on Saturday was one that I almost skipped, due to its 8:00am time. Laura Gurak and Trent Kays, in “Materiality and Digital Spaces as Agents of Rhetorics of Change” (F12) both presented on ethos in digital spaces. Dr. Gurak discussed trust and ethos in online spaces, and Kays spoke on crowdsourcing and scientific ethos. Since one of the chapters of my dissertation invokes trust in terms of computer code and network protocols, I found Dr. Gurak’s discussion of how trust and ethos constitute one another in online spaces to be fascinating. Furthermore, she discussed a hard-to-get book my Niklas Luhmann, &lt;em&gt;Trust and Power&lt;/em&gt;, which I need to get my hands on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the afternoon, I attended panel J14, “Literacy as a Rhetorical Object,” primarily to see Annette Vee discuss coding and literacy. I agreed with her general position that framing coding as literacy is perhaps justified, but also a move of power in that it creates a crisis of literacy framed around a new tool that is often harnessed for capital gains. Coding as literacy uses the rhetoric of empowerment to then create an impetus for success: those who do not gain this literacy are therefore not empowered, even though many can and should do just fine without ever learning how to code. Lynn Lewis, in her follow-up on technology and time, gave a fantastic discussion of how Pearson publishing frames education as a crisis of time and expediency, and that their technologies (Pearson Writer, Blackboard) are situated as solutions to these crises. It reminds me how firmly certain technologies are embedded within our pedagogues, even if a teacher does not necessarily incorporate tech into their classes. My USC students are all plugged in to Blackboard and, understandably, like when I use the platform as it works with all of their other classes. The local community college, Midlands Technical College, uses Brightspace D2L, and I am actually required to use the platform for grading, course content, and attendance. Lewis’ argument, however, reminded me that our technology, even if we think it in the background or an institutional nuisance, is loaded with ideological baggage and influential politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Lynn Lewis: &amp;quot;Pearson has been described as a corporate octopus&amp;quot; ...

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Lynn, citing Trimbur/Marcuse: Pearson caps on literacy crisis b/c crises are typically invoked by cultural stakeholders &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/j14?src=hash&quot;&gt;#j14&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/RSA16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#RSA16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Gerald Jackson (@geraldsjackson) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/geraldsjackson/status/736632506292830208&quot;&gt;May 28, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Lynn: Tech is seen as neutral application for addressing seeming decaying cultural competence via literacy &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/j14?src=hash&quot;&gt;#j14&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/RSA16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#RSA16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Gerald Jackson (@geraldsjackson) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/geraldsjackson/status/736632718201638912&quot;&gt;May 28, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I would remiss if I didn’t mention my final panel of the day, “Rhetoric as Change, Rhetoric as Circulation” (K17). This was a speedier panel featuring authors from the upcoming book on Rhetoric and Circulation (in which I also have a chapter). Authors discussed circulation in terms of digital monuments, public graffiti, open source digital humanities projects, and others. The discussions were shorter in length due to a larger panel of participants, but the showing was great and I think it really provoked interest in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My first day at the Rhetoric Society of America Biennial Conference 2016 was actually only a half-day, unfortunately. Driving in from Columbia, SC, I spent a good portion of the day in the car passing through Georgia and South Carolina. Perhaps unrelated to the conference itself but not to my own experience, the travel west from SC to Georgia is actually incredibly nice. The road conditions also improve tremendously, but this seems to be the case no matter what direction you leave the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Presentations of Note:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joan Faber McAlister presented “Inside Amy Schumer: Celebrating and Critiquing Comedic Modes in (PostFeminism)” (D14), a great talk on Schumer, her focus on women’s issues, and the status of her popular show on Comedy Central. Faber noted that Schumer, perhaps unlike other female comedians, has reached across gendered audiences to attract an audience of men as well as women. Faber cites critics who referenced her comedy as sort of “bro,” in that it (and her stand up, if you have ever heard it) are frank in their discussion of race, class, gender, and sexuality. Schumer often takes on the character of a cluelessly spoiled white American, which situates her comedy as a biting critique of social norms thorugh parody. However, as Faber pointed out, this causes some friction in how her comedy is recieved, in that Schumer rarely addresses race overtly and her performances can reify uncomortable racial categories rather than critique them. Faber’s ultimate point, that a feminist comedic approach to cultural critique well be messy and sometimes incomplete, does not foreclose seeing Schumer’s work as important. Instead, it invites us to interrogate humor as a challenge to the cliched “humorless feminist” and investigate feminism’s role in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the “Rhetorics and Aesthetics” panel (E3), I listened to two great talks (which is great, as I attended the panel on a whim). In the first, Jess Boykin discussed comics and invitational rhetoric in “Filling the Gaps: Invitational Rhetoric and the Graphical Biography,” she uses the graphical biographies of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcom X, and Nelson Mandela to show how whitespace between panels in the comics invite readers to construct their own meaning alongside the comic. Rather than an enthymematic logic of persuasion, the whitespace invites readers into a conversation regarding the action in the comic and what it expresses. The second, “Beautiful Subversions: (re)Covering and (re)Examining the Transvestite Visualities and Feminists Rhetorics of 19th Century Author and Actor Adah Issacs Menken,”  by Jeanne Bohannon, uses archival material of Menken to show how the gendered work of drag in media found root in the theatrics and reproducibility in photography. Menken posed both in clothing that was traditionally male and female, and often blurred the lines between the two (for example, wearing men’s clothing but exposing her breasts). Bohannon argued that recovering this kind of visual rhetoric is important, in that Menken used a transvestite visuality to express her interpretations of her own gender and sexuality at a time when such images were often portrayed as lewd or corrupt. Bohannon’s work tied together a study of the medium and the archive to discuss why the rhetoric’s of Menken could be recovered as a feminist or queer rhetoric of visual media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think both panels set me up for a good conference outing. There were a few I missed early on due to my drive, but I was rewarded with some interesting discussion and ideas. I enjoyed that both of these panels, at least in some way, were dealing with media, or at least different discourses than I am used to discussing: namely sketch comedy and photography. I had done some work on African-American activists and performance through photography for a course (with a paper I hope to return to someday) so Bohannon’s talk was a great surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/women_articulate.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Until we engage that question and the ideological commitment to (particular) divisions of nature and culture, all attempts to borrow from theories that critique humanism (in the name of making humanistic rhetoric more open to different ways of thinking) will assimilate and domesticate epistemological challenges (258).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&quot;Articulation: A Working Paper on Rhetoric and Taxis&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stormer argues that critique of humanist theory is mired within a distinct separation of culture and nature, or more specifically discourse and materiality, which limits how we as cholars can approach new modes of rhetorical investigation. His agenda here is historiographical, in that he seeks to address rhetoric as a performative agency, rather than the product of a necessary human agency. Rhetoric, in this sense, is a product of discursive and material practices (which can be “a space, and image, a canonized activity, or a network of relationships”) rather than an innate human capacity (259). He draws from the Greek &lt;em&gt;taxis&lt;/em&gt;, the skill of mapping one’s mind into language through the ordering of discursive elements to produce a desired effect in an audience. Stormer uses this to discuss &lt;em&gt;articulation&lt;/em&gt; as a relational term: a point of articulation is the point that joins multiple  possibilities or entities, that delimits “a range of motions or possible actions” and that “defines parameters for enactment” (264). Order, &lt;em&gt;taxis&lt;/em&gt;, is refigured here not as the production of order by a human agency, but the agential capacity of order itself to express possibilities for different rhetorics. “Rhetorics” here is plural precisely because, with different material-discursive configurations, we see the production of different rhetorics from different arrangements or orders. Articulation, as the rhetorical work of order, is the production of discourse, languages, bodies, and space. Stormer argues that the study of order, “the historical rules whereby something separates from act and becomes text” is the study of articulation as an “posthumanistic historiographical perspective” (276). Where does the “text” that we analyze become a text separate from the production of rhetorical possibility that begat it? How does order, as a foundation for rhetoric, function rhetorically? What does this implicate when we think about bodies and discourses as performative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As defined here, articulation places agency in networks; it makes rhetoric a historically contingent phenomenon (275).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My understanding, then, is that order is not a given within a system: there is no inevitability with order. Instead, order is performative, but the nature of that performativity is rooted in the order itself as a recursive process of networks (re)iterating their structure through performing bodies and discourses. The application of such a realization, I think, has pretty wide-reaching implications for the study of performativity (and Stormer touches on gender performativity here) and the performativity of technology. In a world of technology rooted in structure and code, articulation offers us new ways to think about how digital media in particular functions rhetorically to reiterate values and practices that may not, on their surface, be recognized as such. In the above image, the word “articulate” is an adjective, denoting the (obviously gendered) notion of what it means to “be” articulate: to make sense in an orderly fashion. But a switch to the verb “articulate” shifts the understanding of the word not as a quality (good at communicating, good and recognizing order and leveraging it) but as a production of order through performance. The latter suggests the performativity Stormer describes, as it would locate within a network of practices the very question of what it means to &lt;em&gt;be articulate&lt;/em&gt;. Further, it offers a chance to think about &lt;em&gt;how to articulate&lt;/em&gt;, not as a human speaker but as a performative rhetorical structure–which, as a goal of Stormer’s, de-centers human agency as the focal point of rhetorical theory and history. Therefore, questions of gender performativity &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; media, or structural race &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; media, does not require recourse to a speaking subject for validity. Instead, practices can be traced through media structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the Pirate Party uses a platform called “Liquid Feedback” (aka, &lt;a href=&quot;http://liquidfeedback.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;The Democracy Software&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to perform a new politics. Budde writes that “The Pirate Party does not stand for certain policies, but for a new way of doing politics that challenges established notions of parliamentary democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we equate a swarm intelligence, framed as a political performance, with democracy? It seems to be radically distributed, in that the party does not vote on any particular issue, but on the issues voted on by users of their Liquid Feedback platorm. But, otherwise, while this is seemingly a move towards radical participation, it also demonstrates a concern in how we produce a democratic practice in software. Is that possible? What does it mean to “code” a democracy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So above I’m posting a PDF image of a thought map I created to aid my study for Qualifying Exams this October. It essentially marks some of the major movements of composition, starting with the teaching of speech and composition in English through some contemporary post-process theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This map is skeletal, obviously, in that I cannot hope to cover the entirety of comp theory in one document (or by myself). however, this is a start, I think, and any suggestions as to the expansion of the map, or the filling of holes in the map, or additional sources for the map, are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reflection at RSA 2016, Day 2 &#8211; Gerald Jackson</title>
<meta name="description" content="The second day of RSA was a full one. I don’t often panel from morning to night, but with the fall Job Market coming up I wanted to be present at as many panels as possible and meet a few people. I could, throughout the 2-3 days that I was present in Atlanta, palpably feel the upcoming job search: some of these folks, hopefully, would run searches for their respective universities, perhaps sit on hiring committees, perhaps even become future colleagues. As I prepare my dissertation and my documents, I feel a mix of excitement and uncertainty, but also hope–the conversations I had tended to ground me in my work and the people who share my interests in the field, and helped calm some of the uncertainties that I felt.

      <p>The second day of RSA was a full one. I don’t often panel from morning to night, but with the fall Job Market coming up I wanted to be present at as many panels as possible and meet a few people. I could, throughout the 2-3 days that I was present in Atlanta, palpably feel the upcoming job search: some of these folks, hopefully, would run searches for their respective universities, perhaps sit on hiring committees, perhaps even become future colleagues.

<h4>Panels</h4>
<p>One of the most fun panels I went to on Saturday was one that I almost skipped, due to its 8:00am time. Laura Gurak and Trent Kays, in “Materiality and Digital Spaces as Agents of Rhetorics of Change” (F12) both presented on ethos in digital spaces. Dr. Gurak discussed trust and ethos in online spaces, and Kays spoke on crowdsourcing and scientific ethos. Since one of the chapters of my dissertation invokes trust in terms of computer code and network protocols, I found Dr. Gurak’s discussion of how trust and ethos constitute one another in online spaces to be fascinating. Furthermore, she discussed a hard-to-get book my Niklas Luhmann, <em>Trust and Power</em>, which I need to get my hands on.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, I attended panel J14, “Literacy as a Rhetorical Object,” primarily to see Annette Vee discuss coding and literacy. I agreed with her general position that framing coding as literacy is perhaps justified, but also a move of power in that it creates a crisis of literacy framed around a new tool that is often harnessed for capital gains. Coding as literacy uses the rhetoric of empowerment to then create an impetus for success: those who do not gain this literacy are therefore not empowered, even though many can and should do just fine without ever learning how to code. Lynn Lewis, in her follow-up on technology and time, gave a fantastic discussion of how Pearson publishing frames education as a crisis of time and expediency, and that their technologies (Pearson Writer, Blackboard) are situated as solutions to these crises. It reminds me how firmly certain technologies are embedded within our pedagogues, even if a teacher does not necessarily incorporate tech into their classes. My USC students are all plugged in to Blackboard and, understandably, like when I use the platform as it works with all of their other classes. The local community college, Midlands Technical College, uses Brightspace D2L, and I am actually required to use the platform for grading, course content, and attendance. Lewis’ argument, however, reminded me that our technology, even if we think it in the background or an institutional nuisance, is loaded with ideological baggage and influential politics.</p>

I would remiss if I didn’t mention my final panel of the day, “Rhetoric as Change, Rhetoric as Circulation” (K17). This was a speedier panel featuring authors from the upcoming book on Rhetoric and Circulation (in which I also have a chapter). Authors discussed circulation in terms of digital monuments, public graffiti, open source digital humanities projects, and others. The discussions were shorter in length due to a larger panel of participants, but the showing was great and I think it really provoked interest in the book.</p>

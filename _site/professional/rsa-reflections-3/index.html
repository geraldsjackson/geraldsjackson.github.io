<title>Reflection at RSA 2016, Day 3 &#8211; Gerald Jackson</title>
<meta name="description" content="Since I presented on the third day of the conference, I approached it in a state of exhaustion and excitement. Presenting is always exciting, but after a full day the previous day (including the Coalition of Women Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition and Enculturation parties) left me a bit slow to go that morning. Since our panel – 015, “Sex, Consent, and Digital Disidentifications in Queer Media and Technology” – didn’t begin until 11:00am I had time to sleep a little and prepare. I realized that I missed some interesting panels but I am never one to forego nervous, last-minute quadruple-checking of all that I needed to do, followed by multiple radings of the presentation. Luckily, my co-panelists were Jacqueline Rhodes, Jonathan Alexander, and Michael J. Faris, who were all wonderful. Much of my excitement stemmed from the fact that this was the first panel I had put together, and that my co-panelists had agreed to be a part of it.

      <p>Since I presented on the third day of the conference, I approached it in a state of exhaustion and excitement. Presenting is always exciting, but after a full day the previous day (including the Coalition of Women Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition and <em>Enculturation</em> parties) left me a bit slow to go that morning. Since our panel – 015, “Sex, Consent, and Digital Disidentifications in Queer Media and Technology” – didn’t begin until 11:00am I had time to sleep a little and prepare. I realized that I missed some interesting panels but I am never one to forego nervous, last-minute quadruple-checking of all that I needed to do, followed by multiple radings of the presentation. Luckily, my co-panelists were Jacqueline Rhodes, Jonathan Alexander, and Michael J. Faris, who were all wonderful. Much of my excitement stemmed from the fact that this was the first panel I had put together, and that my co-panelists had agreed to be a part of it.</p>

<p>Jacquie and Jonathan both presented on Object Oriented Ontology and the question of consent. After beginning with a discussion of OOO through Ian Bogost’s work in <em>Alien Phenomenology</em>, Rhodes and Alexander suggested that such an approach qould not be able to give us a position to ask the question “Do Objects concent” to our use of them, and instead invoked Jane Bennet’s <em>Vibrant Matter</em>. The claim of these speakers (who presented in tandem, alternating speaking roles in their presentation) was not an argument that objects could consent to our use, but that we can’t argue that <em>they</em> can’t consent either. To impose the question of consent on matter implies an inability to think about the inner workings of matter, but at the same time a limitation to our knowledges about the participatory nature of matter in our lives, including in how we make decisisions about concent. Their argument suggested that in considering matter as part of embodied, decision-making processes, we could in fact open up what it means to give or recieve consent for any action.</p>

<p>Michael’s presentation focused on the embodied materiality of the online dating service Grindr, targeted primarily to a gay male users looking for companionship, sex, coffee, or simply conversation. True to the title of the panel, this was a “sensory ethnography,” in that Michael took us through the world of Grindr through his own experiences, displaying his user account profile and discussing when, why, and how the app participated in his life. His take on Grindr was that his connection to the app, and the communing, is such that there are powerful affective, embodied responses that the app provokes. This can come from more straightforward cues (the use of profile pictures and body shots) and on cues tied to the app itself (updates, notifications, etc.).</p>

<p>As I prepare to go onto the market in the fall and finish my dissertation, this year’s RSA was a welcome reminder of how excited I can feel about the field and my potential place in it. It makes me much more hopeful and energized for the upcoming fall.</p>

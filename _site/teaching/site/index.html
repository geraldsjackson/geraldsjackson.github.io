<h5>Description</h5>

<p>English 102 - Collaborative Research and Writing functions as an introduction to scholarly research and writing at the college level. Specific to this class, we will practice writing as a collaborative effort between peers working towards shared goals. Writing is often seen as a solitary act, done in the comfort of one's office with little or no outside discussion other than what occurs during teacher conferences. However, writing in "real life" (and take that however you might) often functions collaboratively: in personal and professional life, writers often collaborate with others, either through hands on collaboration (multiple authors) or through consultation. This class will focus on constructing writing projects as multi-authored endeavors.</p>

<h5>Course Policies</h5>

<p>I grade on a 10-point scale (A=90-100; B+=88-89; B=80-87; C+=78-79; C=70-77; D+=68-69; D=60-67; F=50). My grades fall on a high-end scale: if you get an A, you get 100%, if you get a B, you get 89%, and so on. Whatever letter grade you recieve will earn you the highest number of points for that letter grade, based on the total points of the assignment. If you have a question about a grade you receive on an assignment, please feel free to discuss it with me in my office.</p><br />

<p>Attendance: This class is grounded in workshop activities and class discussion, so it’s important to attend. If you need to miss a class, please submit in advance any work due on that day and consult our class site before the next class period to catch up on what you’ve missed. In accordance with University policy, anyone who misses 25% of our scheduled class periods will fail the course, and anyone who misses more than 10% will receive a one-letter deduction from the course grade. Please note that the University’s attendance policy does not distinguish between “excused” and “unexcused” absences.  However, if an emergency forces you to miss class, I will try to work with you—if you contact me as soon as possible and make arrangements to catch up quickly on missed work. Even if you have an emergency, if you must miss more than two classes beyond the 10% absence threshold, you should consider withdrawing from the course.</p><br />

<p>Revision: This class will include rolling submission deadlines with frequent progress updates. As such, revisions submitted after the due date for a particular project will only be accepted at the end of the semester, and only after consultation with me.</p><br />

<p>Late Papers: I don't accept late work. Period.</p><br />

<p>Paper Format and Documentation: All work, unless otherwise noted, should be in MLA format, typed and double spaced using 12-point Times New Roman typeface, with 1'' margins all around. Use MLA style to cite and properly document any outside sources you draw on in your papers.  We will talk more about MLA format and citation in class.</p><br />

<p>Academic Honesty: You are bound by the university's policies on academic honesty, which bar you from presenting another person’s work or ideas as your own, allowing someone to write an assignment or part of an assignment for you, or neglecting to properly acknowledge source materials. First-Year English policy also prohibits you from recycling work—that is, from turning in a paper completed in another class for credit in this class. The university takes violations of these policies seriously; penalties include failing the course and expulsion from the university. You are also responsible for reading the Academic Responsibility section of The Student’s Guide to First-Year English on the English Department Website.  We will learn about and discuss strategies for research and source use, citation, and documentation throughout the semester.  If you have any questions about academic honesty or use of source materials, please come to me before the assignment is due.</p><br />

<p>Class Participation and Courtesy: This is a DISCLAIMER: This course requires participation. Participation in class discussions, readings, and conferences. Engagement with your peers, your instructor, the material and your writing are musts. As such, I include a participation grade. Students who do not speak in class, text in class, sleep in class, are disruptive or belligerent in class, never speak to me about their work, and those who generally are unwilling to participate in any way will have their grade affected.</p><br />

<p>The prime directive for this course is this: participate, and respect each other, respect the class, and respect your teacher. Students who come unprepared (not having read, unresponsive to direct engagement from the teacher or other students), students who want to sleep during class, students who do not participate in discussions, workshops, or conferences, and students who are directly disrespectful, disruptive, or threatening will be asked to leave, garnering an absence for the day. I am always open to differing opinions, spirited discussion, engaged debate, and so on, but I have no patience or tolerance for any of the above-listed offenses.</p><br /> </div>

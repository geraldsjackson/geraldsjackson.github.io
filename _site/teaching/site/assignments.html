<h5>ILP</h5>
<ol><li><strong>Google, Research, and Topic Generation</strong><br />
This writing assignment asks you to Google a possible research topic. You can use any available Google technologies (General Search, Google Scholar, Image Search, Google News) to locate resources. Then take two of those sources and summarize their discussion of the topic. In particular, not how the source discusses the topic from a particular view. Major news outlets will typically report in a similar fashion, but their editorial pages will work differently, reviews sites and blogs will work differently, as well gameplay review websites. Write a concise summary of two sources, each summary working out to about 300-400 words. Within the summary, discuss the source itself and how it approaches the topic. Try to get two sources from different views (that is, don’t do CNN and MSNBC, but a CNN article and an longer blogpost would provide interesting contrast. No Wikipedia.
</li><br />

<li><strong>Wikipedia and Research</strong><br />
Go to the Wikipedia main page and search for the object of inquiry for your research. On its main page, skim the information available, then move to the bottom of the article and locate the Resources section. Choose 2 resources from this list and, noting them in your writing, summarize each in 200-300 words in the same fashion as ILP 1. Do not refer to technical manuals or specifications: focus on review pieces, argumentative pieces, or editorial pieces. </li><br />

<li><strong>Researching and the Citation Trail</strong><br />
Referring back to your second ILP assignment, pick one of the resources from ILP 2 and read it again. Write a small 100 word summary. Then, within that source, find some other source it references (either in a works cited section, in a hyper link, or simply by name) and locate that source. Write another 100 word summary of this second source. Repeat this again for your third source. If you have time, continue to do more until the class ends.</li><br />

<li><strong>Annotation and the Bigger Picture</strong><br />
For this ILP, chose one source (you can either take one you already have, or take class time to find one) and write a minimum 250 word annotation on it. Look to the annotated bibliography assignment sheet for guidelines. Primarily, your annotation for this exercise should explicate the source and explicate how it could possibly inform your project. This means discussing (briefly) what your project might be and where this item fits in. 
</li><br />

<li><strong>Speaking with Sources</strong><br />
This ILP will build from the previous one: take your source from ILP 4 and a new source related to your project (or two new ones, if you must) and write two new annotations. These annotations should both speak to the overarching goal of your project. As in ILP 4, these should explicate the source and how it fits: however, each source should address some different aspect of the research. That is, they shouldn’t be doing the same work, they should both bring something “new” to the table.<br />
</li>
    
<li><strong>Sources Speaking</strong><br /> 
    Building off of ILPs 4 and 5, take two new sources and write annotations for them. Including summaries and including discussion of importance to the project, these annotations should also refer to each other in some way. That is, if one resource bolsters the claim of another, or augments it, or argues against it, your annotations should reflect this. Your annotations here should illustrate how your sources speak to each other, and how you are navigating these voices. </li><br />
    
<li><strong>Persuasive Argument: Authority and Synthesis</strong><br />
For this ILP, you will take three of your current sources. You will then write a 500 word discussion of those sources, citing text from each one. Your goal here is not to explain each source: rather, you are to construct a coherent position (not necessarily an argument, but a position) that these three sources support. You will use proper MLA citation and you will use all three sources throughout. </li><br />
    
<li><strong>Persuasive Argument: Entering the Conversation</strong><br />
    Building from ILP 9, you will take the same three sources and the previous 500 word discussion as your guide. From this, you will write another 500 words analyzing this discussion. That is, you will answer the following questions: 1) What is the conversation these resources are a part of? 2)What kind of questions are they responding to? 3) How does my project fit within this conversation? The goal here is to understand your engagement with these sources not at sources that are used as needed, but as inquiries written by scholars who have spent their entire lives working on these discussions. That is, you have an ethical obligation to consider them as existing not simply for your use but for your engagement and understanding. </li><br />

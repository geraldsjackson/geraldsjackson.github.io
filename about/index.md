I am a fourth year PhD candidate in the [<font color="blue">University of South Carolina department of English</font>](http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/engl/graduate-program), specializing in Rhetoric and Composition. I am also completing a certificate in [<font color="blue">Women's and Gender Studies</font>](http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/wgst/front-page). I hold degrees in [<font color="blue">Rhetoric and Composition with a specialization in composition pedagogy</font>](http://www.siue.edu/artsandsciences/english/graduate/tow/index.shtml) (MA), and English with a minor in Computer Science (BA) from Southern Illinois University

In my dissertation, "Queer Epistemologies: Studies of Computational Performativity in Gendered Network Spaces," I introduce the concept of computational performativity to explore how underlying coding practices of software and digital networks reiterate and propagate cultural norms. Specifically, I trace the movement of gendered practices of programming and knowledge-making through network protocols and software as those practices are proliferated by concealed processes underlying source code.

In addition to my research, I teach courses in first-year composition and professional and technical writing. I have taught courses in research and argumentation and basic writing at both two and four-year institutions. I also served as Assistant Director of First-Year English at the University of South Carolina for two years. 

I am the co-founder and senior editor of the academic journal, [<font color="blue">Itineration: Cross-Disciplinary Studies in Rhetoric, Media, and Culture</font>](http://tundra.csd.sc.edu/itineration/).

Outside of academic work, I enjoy reading, writing, and watching television and movies. I have been an on-and-off science fiction fan my entire life, and currently I am nurturing an increasing fandom for Dr. Who and The Americans (the last is not sci-fi, but whatever). I enjoy playing classic video games, tinkering with computer code, and jogging. 

Also, I have a beautiful wife and daughter who have, in many ways, made all of this possible. I can't imagine any hobbies or professional committments without either of them in my life, and for that I am forever thankful.

I am a fourth year PhD candidate in the [University of South Carolina department of English](http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/engl/graduate-program), specializing in Rhetoric and Composition. I am also completing a certificate in [Women's and Gender Studies](http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/wgst/front-page). I hold degrees in [Rhetoric and Composition with a specialization in composition pedagogy](http://www.siue.edu/artsandsciences/english/graduate/tow/index.shtml) (MA), and English with a minor in Computer Science (BA) from Southern Illinois University

<br />
In my dissertation, "Queer Epistemologies: Studies of 
Computational Performativity in Gendered Network Spaces," I introduce the concept of computational performativity to explore how underlying coding practices of software and digital networks reiterate and propagate cultural norms. Specifically, I trace the movement of gendered practices of programming and knowledge-making through network protocols and software as those practices are proliferated by concealed processes underlying source code.

<br />
In addition to my research, I teach courses in first-year composition and professional and technical writing. I have taught courses in research and argumentation and basic writing at both two and four-year institutions. I also served as Assistant Director of First-Year English at the University of South Carolina for two years. 

<br />
I am the co-founder and senior editor of the academic journal, [Itineration: Cross-DIsciplinary Studies in Rhetoric, Media, and Culture](http://tundra.csd.sc.edu/itineration/).
